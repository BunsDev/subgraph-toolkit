## Features ‚ú®

This library complements and extends the official library `@graphprotocol/graph-ts` with the following functionality: 
- [x] Helper functions to convert between different types not available in the standard library
    - [x] Convert Bytes to Address
    - [x] Convert Bytes to signed and unsigned integer
    - [x] Convert BigDecimal to BigInt with a given precision
    - [x] Convert BigInt to Bytes
    - [x] Convert BigInt to BigDecimal with a given precision
- [x] Useful constants ready to use in the subgraph mappings (including numeric constants, addresses, hashes and more)
- [x] Calculate maximum and minimum of BigInt and BigDecimal values
- [x] Hex Strings helpers
- [x] Counters
- [x] Accumulators
- [ ] Helper functions to handle aggregated data [WIP]
- [ ] Utilities to manipulate tokens (ERC20/ERC721/ERC1115)


## Install üêô

```bash
  $ yarn add @protofire/subgraph-toolkit --exact
```

>
>**NOTE**
>
>It's recommended installing a specific version of this library since the API in early versions is subject to change without previous notice.

## Usage üí°


```typescript
import { integer, decimal, DEFAULT_DECIMALS, ZERO_ADDRESS } from '@protofire/subgraph-toolkit'

// ...

export function handleTransfer(event: Transfer): void {
  // ...
  
  if (event.params._to.toHexString == ZERO_ADDRESS) {
    let amount = decimal.max(
      decimal.ZERO,
      decimal.fromBigInt(event.params._value, DEFAULT_DECIMALS)
    )

    totalBurned += amount

    burnCount = integer.increment(burnCount)
  }
  
  // ...
}

// ...

```

### Counters and accumulators

To use metrics module you need to append the content of [schema.graphql](./schema.graphql) to the subgraph schema.


### Prettier configuration

This package also provides an opinionated Prettier configuration file. To apply this configuration:

```javascript
// prettier.config.js or .prettierrc.js

module.exports = require('@protofire/subgraph-toolkit/prettier.config.js')
```

To override and/or extend the configuration:

```javascript
// prettier.config.js or .prettierrc.js

module.exports = {
  ...require('@protofire/subgraph-toolkit/prettier.config.js'),

  printWidth: 120,

  overrides: [
    {
      files: '*.json',
      options: {
        printWidth: 80,
      },
    },
  ],
}
```


## Examples üñç

The following subgraphs are using this library:
* [Maker Protocol](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/protofire/maker-protocol)
* [Curve](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/protofire/curve)
